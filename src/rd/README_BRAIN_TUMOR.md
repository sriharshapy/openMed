## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install mlflow
pip install scikit-learn
pip install imbalanced-learn
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
pip install pillow
pip install tqdm
pip install numpy
```

### 1. Training the Model

```bash
cd src/rd
python resnet50_brain_tumor.py
```

**What happens during training:**
1. **Data Organization**: If not already organized, the script will automatically split the brain tumor dataset into train/test (80/20 split)
2. **Model Setup**: Loads ResNet50 with ImageNet weights, freezes features, replaces final layer for 3-class classification
3. **Training**: Uses data augmentation, mixed precision training (if CUDA available), learning rate scheduling
4. **Monitoring**: MLflow tracks all metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts
5. **Checkpointing**: Saves best model and periodic checkpoints

**Expected Output:**
```
Organizing Brain Tumor dataset for the first time...
Found XXXX images in brain_glioma class
  Training: XXXX images
  Testing: XXXX images
Found XXXX images in brain_menin class
  Training: XXXX images
  Testing: XXXX images
Found XXXX images in brain_tumor class
  Training: XXXX images
  Testing: XXXX images

...
```

### 2. GradCAM Visualization

**After training is complete**, run:

```bash
python resnet50_gradcam_brain_tumor.py
```

**What this does:**
1. Loads the trained model from `./checkpoints/resnet50_brain_tumor/best_resnet50_brain_tumor_finetuned.pth`
2. Loads test images from the organized dataset
3. Generates GradCAM heatmaps showing what the model focuses on
4. Creates advanced visualizations with 4-panel layout:
   - Original MRI image
   - GradCAM heatmap
   - Overlaid visualization
   - Class probability distribution
5. Saves results to `./gradcam_results/resnet50_brain_tumor/`

## üîç Key Differences from Binary Classification

### Multi-class Considerations
- **Classes**: 3-class classification (vs 2-class for TB/Pneumonia)
- **Metrics**: Multi-class AUC using one-vs-rest approach
- **Visualization**: Enhanced 4-panel layout with probability distributions
- **Complexity**: More challenging classification task

### Enhanced Features
- **Advanced GradCAM**: 4-panel visualization showing original image, heatmap, overlay, and probability distribution
- **Multi-class Metrics**: Weighted F1, precision, recall, and per-class performance
- **Probability Analysis**: Bar charts showing confidence across all 3 classes
- **Detailed Logging**: Classification reports and confusion matrices

### Dataset Class
- **Class Name**: `BrainTumorDataset` (instead of binary datasets)
- **Classes**: brain_glioma, brain_menin, brain_tumor
- **Extensions**: Support for multiple medical image formats
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for medical imaging data

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dataset Not Found**
   ```
   Error: C:\Users\sriha\NEU\shlabs\HP_NVIDIA\Brain_Cancer raw MRI data\Brain_Cancer does not exist
   ```
   **Solution**: Verify the data path in the script matches your actual data location

2. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   ```
   RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
   ```
   **Solution**: Reduce batch_size in the config (e.g., from 32 to 16 or 8)

3. **Model Not Found for GradCAM**
   ```
   FileNotFoundError: Model checkpoint not found
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure you've trained the model first using `resnet50_brain_tumor.py`

4. **Imbalanced Classes**
   ```
   Warning: Class imbalance detected
   ```
   **Solution**: Consider using class weights or additional data augmentation

### Performance Tips

1. **GPU Memory**: If you have limited GPU memory, reduce batch size
2. **Training Speed**: Enable AMP (automatic mixed precision) for faster training on modern GPUs
3. **Data Loading**: Adjust `num_workers` in DataLoader based on your CPU cores
4. **Class Balance**: Monitor per-class performance in MLflow

## üìã Expected Performance
