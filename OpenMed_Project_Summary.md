# OpenMed: AI-Powered Medical Image Classification Platform

## Inspiration

The inspiration for OpenMed emerged from the critical need to democratize medical imaging diagnostics, particularly in resource-constrained healthcare environments. With pneumonia being one of the leading causes of death globally, especially among children and the elderly, there's an urgent need for rapid, accurate, and accessible diagnostic tools. Traditional radiological diagnosis requires extensive training and experience, while many healthcare facilities lack sufficient radiologists. OpenMed was conceived to bridge this gap by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models to provide instant, reliable chest X-ray analysis that can assist healthcare professionals in making faster, more accurate diagnostic decisions.

## What it does

OpenMed is a comprehensive AI-powered medical image classification platform specifically designed for chest X-ray analysis. The platform:

- **Performs Binary Classification**: Distinguishes between normal chest X-rays and those showing signs of pneumonia with high accuracy
- **Supports Multiple AI Architectures**: Implements three state-of-the-art deep learning models:
  - **ResNet50**: Convolutional Neural Network excellent for medical imaging with proven performance and fast inference
  - **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Transformer-based architecture providing state-of-the-art accuracy with attention visualization capabilities
  - **InceptionV3**: Multi-scale feature extraction suitable for complex medical images
- **Provides Explainable AI**: Integrates GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and attention visualization to show exactly which regions of the X-ray influenced the diagnostic decision
- **Offers Modular Architecture**: Features a clean, extensible codebase with factory patterns, abstract base classes, and standardized interfaces
- **Enables Research and Deployment**: Supports both research experimentation (in `rd/` directory) and production-ready inference (in `models/` and `utils/`)
- **Includes Comprehensive Testing**: Provides extensive unit tests and validation frameworks to ensure reliability
- **Tracks Experiments**: Integrates with MLflow for experiment tracking and model performance monitoring
